# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Given the ellipse equation:

(x-2)Â²/36 + (y+1)Â²/25 = 1



Perform the following tasks using **OpenGL**:

---

## 1. Draw the Ellipse in OpenGL  
Draw the ellipse defined above with its **center at (2,-1)**.

---

## 2. Fill the Ellipse Using Flood-Fill Algorithm  
Apply the **flood-fill algorithm** to fill the **interior** of the ellipse with **cyan color**.

---

## 3. Apply Shear Transformation  
Apply a **shear transformation** with parameters:

- Shear X-axis: `shearX = 2`  
- Shear Y-axis: `shearY = 2`  

Then:

- Compute the **new coordinates** of the sheared ellipse.
- Plot the **sheared ellipse** using OpenGL.

---

## 4. Implement Anti-Aliasing  
Develop an algorithm to apply **anti-aliasing** to the **elliptical boundaries** of the above figure.

---

## 5. Apply Boundary Fill  
Using OpenGL, write a program to perform **boundary fill** of the **sheared ellipse** (from step 3) with **green color**.
